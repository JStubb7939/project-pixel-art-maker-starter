## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repo and run `npm install` in the project directory.
Once the packages are installed, run `npm start` in the project directory and navigate to `localhost:1337` in your web browser.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Testing

This directory is set up to run Protractor tests. To run the tests, use the `npm run webdriver` and then `npm test` commands. This runs the test spec file in ./test/pixel-art-spec.js with the configuration outlined in ./test/conf.js.

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
