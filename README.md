# Pixel Art Maker Project

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repo and run `npm install` in the project directory.
Once the packages are installed, run `npm start` in the project directory and navigate to `localhost:1337` in your web browser.

## Testing

This directory is set up to run Protractor tests. To run the tests, use the `npm run webdriver` and then `npm test` commands. This runs the test spec file in ./test/pixel-art-spec.js with the configuration outlined in ./test/conf.js.
